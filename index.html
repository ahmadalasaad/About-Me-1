<h1>Me guessing game</h1>
<p>My name is Shahd Al-Khatib from Irbid. I am 25 years old.
 I studied computer science at Yarmouk University and graduated at 2017 with a good grade.
  I trained in the field of programming in Amman and
   now I am learning artificial intelligence that depends on machine learning
 to create smart applications that have the ability to think 
like humans. My ambition is to join a job that appreciates my skills.
